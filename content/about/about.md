Hi, my name is Max, and I work hard creating solutions where and when I can. When not at work in IT or at school, I study in 
my free time for certifications to not only further my career, but to understand the networked and binary world as much
as possible. 

Check out my code and projects at git.bootingup.net too.

Thanks for visiting, feel free to ask questions!
