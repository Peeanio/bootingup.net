Following their ancestor's star maps, they discovered the greatest treasure of a past age - a world terraformed and prepared for human life.<br/>   But all is not right in this new Eden. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New monsters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare. Now two civilisations are on a collision course and must fight to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?|https://openlibrary.org/books/OL28225222M/Children_of_Time|
