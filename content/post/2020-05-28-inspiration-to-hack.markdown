Sometimes, one gets the idea of a way to solve a problem, through means of a series of logic that seek to address all of the branching paths that one can anticpate and hope to successfully deal with. The most recent series all involve the Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game, and way to streamline the experience of a player. Such ideas have struck me as ways to automatically roll the dice needed to resolve a combat or shooting step, or to total all of the point neccesary to create an "army" to play with. Things such as an easy utility to search and view the stats and rules of a unit or character are equally as useful, and require just as much attention. 

After thinking of all of these individual possibilites, I had one more: what would happen if one were to glue all of these together? Could one actually successfully play an automated game of 40k using a program to deal with the background math? That's how real problems are solved, a function at a time, added into a whole more useful than a sum of its parts. Even as that realisation struck me, I had more ideas: if I could write AI scripts and playbooks, I could play an automated, single player version. This is inspiration, this is why I love to program. And this may be my next long term project.
