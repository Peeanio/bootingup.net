There's nothing like a vacation to get away and reset some practices in order to get things back on track. I was able to take the time to get away from my work enough to get excited about what I do again. Problem is, I talk to too many people about too many different things, and get REALLY excited about them all. I am driven to be an expert about all of them because they all genuinely interest me and I love doing things, but there's only so much time to do it all. 

I want to learn more pentest/sec hard skills, write applications that I can deploy myself, and roll out infrastructure projects that are scaled, thought out, and advanced. There's only so much time in the day for all that and it's not my day job anymore. I struggle to find the balance, even when trying to complete one project at a time; the projects take enough time (or even so much lead time to start), that by the time I get to them, I've lost steam or something else caught my eye. When writing down the ideas, I just fill pages upon pages of them and can't go back to look because the all still sound like good ideas. 

It's hard when there is nobody to bounce my ideas off with, or split the project load with. Perhaps I'm biting off more than I can chew myself always and need to be a part of a team of like minded people to work together to acomplish things as a group, but that structure does not exist. Every side project I have had to carry myself, due to ability and interest, and they've fallen short. It's early for the new year, but I resolve to get better about prioritisation and get major projects done this year. I hope that there are others along for the ride.
