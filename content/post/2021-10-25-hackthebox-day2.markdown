I spend the day yesterday on hackthebox.eu. I breezed through the Proving Grounds sections, then got dropped in with the released labs. I'm in for some learning. I was on the right track in the one lab I did complete, but was missing some pieces to complete the pwn by myself. Looking forward to my first no-cheating attack. 

Also expect to learn some skills from the challenges. I like the OSINT ones or ZIP file based where you have to do the analysis and get it yourself. Stay posted, as I start sharpening skills there and build up a decent lab. I rebuilt my switching and intend to build up a DMZ to lock down whatever bad things I put there.
