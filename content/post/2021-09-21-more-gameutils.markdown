I started moving a script I was writing from go to python, but I am now seeing the different tiers of closeness to the machine between go, python, and sh. In sh, I am used to using variables where-ever, including stringing them together to call things by "string" + $var. That does not work in go or python. But, with python I do not need to worry about reflection in lists/arrays, as I can call the contents of the arrays by index number. 

My frostgrave warband generator is a strange beast. I wanted to learn go, so I started in that, but got into trouble with that, so I went to python, which is difficult to go back to after spending so much time with sh at work. It should probably be a script, and I should do a more involved project with a more involved language, but hey-ho, I might make my sh better instead of being lazy with it. 

Of course, you can see my code at https://git.bootingup.net
