I have been using BlackArch linux for some pentesting and live USB work. It is an arch based distro with its own special repo for the pentesting tools. So far, it has worked out for me, really as much as I felt Kali did. It uses fluxbox as the WM instead of XFCE like Kali live does, which is a ligher footprint, but not as easy when using live to use wireless. I have used wpa supplicant before, but had issues with DHCP on blackarch for some reason.

Overall, nice and probably be what I use going forward, but nothing wrong with Kali either. These are the first impressions, so will keep posted on further notes
