I recently got back into terrain building for miniatures and miniature wargaming. While I started to played 40k back in middle school, this time around of getting back into the hobby I find myself more drawn to historics. In that vein, I found a copy of Wargames Illustrated with a "How To" guide on building terrain, and I have gotten pretty into it again, although to a better degree I think than my previous terrain. 

I first attempted to do the fence line, which turned out pretty good, and I got to experiment with some new matterials, like XPS foam and clay. I also then built a crater from the same guide, which was a nice looking feature. I plan to play a mix of historicals, 40k and perhaps some other fantasy games, so having pieces that are able to be played in any of those would be great. I'll try adding some pictures to the end of this post
