This is a short post for fun. What does a Lone Ranger IT professional carry with them to get through the day is different for all.

# Pockets
1. Live USB drive. I carry a Kali USB stick to get me out of any sticky spots. Has everything I need to troubleshoot a local computer, and look into external hosts when not at my desk.
2. Keys to the kingdom. Physical and virtual keys stay on me. I have the password database, SSH keys, and old fashioned brass on me so I don't have to run back to the desk.
3. Android phone. Have a great deal of troubleshooting tools on it, but worst case: remote back into the desktop.
4. Knife. Haven't broken a Kershaw yet.
5. Flashlight. Helps having a seperate one from the phone.
# Bag
1. iFixit screwdriver kit. Has enough to get the job done.
2. Toner and probe. For tracking down cables and and testing them.
3. Laptop. I like old, Librebooted or at least Thinkpads (I personally own five), so I may be biased, but anything that you will actually carry works.

The bag gets filled more the bigger the task, but that's a good start with the bare essentials. Let me know what you carry!
