For better or for worse, I have always like World of Warcraft as a game, especially the 1.12 version, known as "vanilla." I found the CMANGOS project after playing on private servers for years, and was excited by what I saw. CMANGOS is an emulator for running a WoW server privately, requiring basically just a SQL database. I fired a server up with little fuss and saw I had found a new potential long term project.

With the CMANGOS server, all that really comes with it is the stock, basic version. Now I did say I liked it, but I saw an opputunity: to learn about managing SQL, and yet more about server administration. To manage the server effectively, I would need to write some tools to do it, such as account registration and management. To play a tailored version of the game for what I really want to play with my friends, I would need to change things, add things, and the way to do this is through the database. So expect more posts and additions to the public git repos with musings, findings, and toolings.
