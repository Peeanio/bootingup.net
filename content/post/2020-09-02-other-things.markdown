It has been a long time since I have updated this blog, and some of you may have noticed a lack of posts for a few months. I deleted my Github account, which included the hosting for this page, and have only just gotten around to hosting the site myself. For anyone curious, my software projects can also be found now at git.bootingup.lan. 

There has been much else that I have been working on. I have a few new certifications I could add to the about me page, most of my networking/computer stacks have remained the same (although I don't want it to stay that way for too long), and I have been fixing up some airsoft guns. For anyone considering it, although it is a stunning looking replica, the ICS L85 is not a fun gun to work on or fix up. I'm wanting to sell another of my weapons, the Knight's Armament Stoner LMG in order to buy a Classic Army M249 Gen 1, as I love the Minimi look. There will be nothing stopping me for looking straight out of Bravo Two Zero. 

But the process continues for wanting to build out the Guards infrastructure (for anyone who hasn't seen or heard of this, I am the main admin for theguards.net too). I run a Matrix/Element server, along with Jitsi, and also doing email for the Guards, but wanting more. However, I want federated credentials, so building out a LDAP domain is my next step, if I can figure out what baseline process I can use for it. Stay tuned for more!
