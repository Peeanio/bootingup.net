I have been working on a another, actual coding project in my spare time. I enjoyed learning Python the first time, and I thought making a quick and easy character generator for pen and paper RPG Cyberpunk 2020 would be a fun reentry. Plus, its 2020! The goal is to have a few options of character templates, get into some guts of Python, and learn to package it by the end of the year. Where it goes from there, who knows. The things that could be done with a simple character generator are pretty vast, so we will see where my ambitions end up. Anyway, follow along on my github.
