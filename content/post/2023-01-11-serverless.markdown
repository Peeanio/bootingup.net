Decemeber got away from me in terms of projects, but this time I actually seemed to learn, create, and achomplish something. I actually learned some HTML and JavaScript to create a serverless application on AWS. Using a Lambda function backed by DynamoDB, APIGateway responds to requests from the aforementioned HTML living in a public S3 bucket. The webpage is rough, but its not my forte or experience so I hope to hash it out more fully in the future. The experience was fun and defintely useful, so I hope I can make further stacks in similar manners. There are already ideas floating around in my head about what to do next, so stay tuned. 

If I publish the app and keep it running, it will be linked from the homepage here.
