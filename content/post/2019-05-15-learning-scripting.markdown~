I should preface by saying I am in no way good, proficent, or authoritative about scripting in *nix or any other computing enviornments. But I have had an absolute blast getting started, and wanted to share my thoughts and discoveries. Anyone else who has already been here, feel free to call me a n00b.

It started out when I found myself installing webmin a lot on my new servers. I got tired of going through the whole things time after time, and I thought it made sense to finially start scripting things. I mean, it is very easy to just chain commands like that together into an executeable script, so that way my first: a shell script to install webmin. I was hooked after that.

I am an IT administrator, so automatation is key to saving time. Something I noticed a few machines having was a lack of reporting over SMART values. I wanted weekly or daily reports about SMART status on disks, so I could know hopefully beforehand about failing disks and system crashes. Now for this script, I wanted it to run, without any hardcoding of disk names or numbers, and to send emails. Sounds pretty straight forward. But to get all this infomation, it took multiple read throughs of several man pages to formulate the equation of getting, finding, and then narrowing down to actually important data about disks. I had to learn about programs that are long-standing tools in the OS aresenal, but most average users don't use for desktop or routine operations. I got to feel like a hacker in the original sense of the word, and it was great. Learning scripting is a fantastic way to increase profeicency and efficency of a given install, and definatly more software-side than I usually like to run.
