For the past few years I have been using Mikrotik routers, a Hex then a CRS, but I have built and installed Opnsense on an amd64 Pentium board. Using VLANs and a switch behind it, I have started to get more serious about my home network. 

Essentially, its time in my mind to get some more practice in with security in WAN settings, but also eperate out my traffic so I am not getting any bleedover that could be dangerous. Currently, nothing is really open, but the firewall is easier on Opnsense than Mikrotik, and I can load the firewall (which is beefy for a firewall) up with some other things like IPS and traffic sniffing. 

I hope to get Snort and Surricata going soon, then look at doing things like 802.1x on my LAN, wired and wireless, just to learn the things. It may mean I have to move away from Mikrotik, as some things may be needed but not onthose switches, which is okay by me. I really like the Arista world, if I could afford it. Lastly, I plan on setting up k8s on some raspberry pis to cut down on the power and noise from my Ryzen NAS/doitall machine. Stay tuned!
