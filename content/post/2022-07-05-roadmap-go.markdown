Writing code has been something that has not been something I found I could just jump into and do for hours, but has been enourmously satisfing, personally and professionally. My public git works show that I have been able to write some small projects, but I have never felt comfortable enough to write anything more than some quick utilites. To me, what feels like a complete project are things like persistent daemons or backends that interface with r/w databases and the like, and learning how to do that is something that could be yet another tool in the belt, or possibly a career change.

So roadmap.sh's golang guide is another thing I want to work on. I have some books on Go that I may be using too, but learning how some of the real deep portions of the language work instead of scripting up like I'm using shell are what is needed next. I've had plenty of ideas, but can't see them to fruition, as I said, projects come and go quickly for me. Following book projects don't feel like "my code," so I lose interest. Pushing myself and making myself accountable is always hard, but when I have no school work or demands at work, I find this is the best way to have personal acchomplishment. So hopefully more work comes up on the git after this.
