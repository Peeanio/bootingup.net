I, like many other people have been working from home more recently, and likely running into the same problems and benefits that others are. 

I'm a fan of working from home for the most part; I defintely feel much more able to get some tasks done. Being able to crank some music while hacking away has usually been only I thing I could do while working on my own projects, but now I can whenever I like! Additionally, I feel much more able to pick and choose what and when to do any given project, without the pressures of someone nearby checking in too closely.

There are a few negatives, however. It is harder to just drop in on someone, so occasionally the wait times are a bit longer to sync up with someone, but this is a good chance to go for a walk or stretch. The lack of movement from waking up and working in the next room is noticeble for those who are used to walking to work daily, but that's more of a behaviorial issue anyway. 

I'm enjoying it, and I hope everyone else can make the most of the occasion!
