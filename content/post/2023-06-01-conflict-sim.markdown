Running a wargame with just military assets feels incomplete in a landscape where intelligence is so real-time and complete, where theatres in a non-shooting war include such amounts of espionage and influence through cyber campaigns and more that it seems so important to model those facets. For the past few years, I've thought about different aspects of what would be needed for that complete picture; running the cyber game, controlling HUMINT sources and directing influence ops, but now it feels like rolling all of that into one is possible. I really want to create an system where it is possible to all kinds of assets and their capabilities, in order to model and run that kind of conflict. Pace will be slow, like all of these, but it's something in my mind, much as one could glean from my reading list from the past year.
