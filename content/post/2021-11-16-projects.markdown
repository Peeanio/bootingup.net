Been struggling again keeping the projects on going, but I started a page of notes regarding projects and some dev ideas. I intend to build up an Okta-like universial directory, with LDAP, SAML, etc, and plug infra into it. Some who have been following may have noticed the codenames.py application, which is intended to be a part of a game I want to write about espionage.

At work, we have been going to lunch often, so I want to write a program that suggests where to go based on what people like/want, balanced against things that are important to them, such as time, distance, price, etc. Could be fun, would likely try it in Go, as the coworkers like that. 

Really just been scratching my dev itch at work, and have not had the time after hours to get anything concrete done.
