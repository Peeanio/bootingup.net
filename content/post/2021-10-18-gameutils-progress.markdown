I spent a lot of time, perhaps an hour a day working on my gameutils frostgrave script. It is currently in a bit of a borked state as I left something unfinished for too long as I was reading a book and need to put in the final stretch. I do want to finish it, as I want to get a project going for the Level1Forums devember challenge. I have some ideas, some more grandiose than others.

First is to inventory CPEs based on either binaries or apt package lists, in order to do linux "local scanning" for vulnerabilities. Second is to write a tool that can map a network based on LLDP information iteratively, ie run it and grab a coffee. I have some other ideas that are more conceptual, but don't know if I can commit to them. Alternatively I can go with something achieveable and do more game scripting. 

Lastly, expect soon some show and tell from some things I have done at work lately. I wrote an SSL scanner, and will soon have some VM scripts to show. I like infrastructure, but have so little at home I need to get my kicks at work. There should be more things I want to run at home.
