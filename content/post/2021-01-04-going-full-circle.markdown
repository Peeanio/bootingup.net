One year ago, I did some testing to get to grips with containers versus VMS. I spun some things up, worked on some composing and automation, and came up with conclusions. I realised what I wanted, and LXC was it; but somehow, I kept working with KVM vms. Coming back to it, once again (but with a sharper eye) I looked at Docker, LXC, and KVM, and for what I want, LXC wins again. Now I need to actually use it ;)

Which brings me to another thing, which will soon get its own posts. With a recent influx of more hardware for my lab, I am working on building out a true enterprise-oriented network, Linux from top to bottom. I want to use GPL code where possible, but free things will do. This will include routing, IDS/IPS, NAC, domain and AAA management, proxies, packet inspection, and many more (I would love to do Linux switching too, but the hardware for that is $). So stay tuned as I work on documenting and making it reproduceable, easily, for viewers like you.
