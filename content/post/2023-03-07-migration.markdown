It has been a busy start to the year for me. I've been working on a good deal of internal projects, but I came to the conclusion that they weren't doing much good where nobody can see them. The projects will slowly be moved to Github (because I am also on a public git server now), and my blog is now housed there too. People have figured out static websites to the point where it is almost silly not to manage them through providers. 

Some of my servers were housed on Linode; there were some price changes and I felt the absence of some AWS features that Linode did not have, so I am rebasing on DigitalOcean. It is a good oppurtunity to get the systems in configuration management and share to the world here. 

Lilac is a project that is fun; to me it makes sense to treat it almost like Luke Smith's Landchad/emailwiz projects, where I write some good automation to share, and let contributions come in if people feel inclined. Having automation on hand I can use as examples and can explain in detail feels worthwhile. 

Maybe when all this feels in a good place I can get back into some of the other things I was working with: Django, Vue.js, CVE's, and LoRA. Stay tuned.
