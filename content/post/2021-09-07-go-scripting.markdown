I tried a scripting project in Go, as I had heard that the language could replace Python in the scripting world. I get that it can be compiled at runtime, but I really struggled writing scripts as I knew them in Go. Aparently, I had taken reflection and dynamic variable assignments for granted while writing in shell or Python, so going to dynamically populating lists or arrays just turned into a mind bending experience. I probably am close to getting it, but can't see me following through with the project I had in mind with Go.

I'd like to learn it and use it, as it does seem slick, but I don't need the performance, and right now the language is getting in my way. As I work on developing my own tools perhaps I will run into barriers Python would be ill advised to surmount, but for now, I think it may be the main tool in my belt. Please, I would love to be proven wrong and shown the light if anyone can.
