Working on the wargame to use for the war between Cascadia and the IRC. I want to use Fistful of Tows, but figure I should try using some other system before that, to a) not need to buy a $75 book and b) not start a real war in the world immediately. So for now, we are going to simulate schirmishes that take place between militias on the border, using the AK47 Republic ruleset.

For the southern warband, named the Democratic Freedom Party, I set them up with a California flag (with a few subtle changes), a nationalist background, and the following units after politics: 1) 3 tanks, 2+3) 5 small arms infantry w/ 1 rpg 1 hmg, 4) 4 armoured cars, 5) 11 militia small arms w/ 3 rpgs and 5 trucks.

The Cascaidans are the People's Chosen Northeners, who are also nationalists, and have 1) 5 old towed guns, 2) 3 tanks with new guns, 3+4) 5 inf 1 rpg 1 hmg, 5) 2 apc halftracks w/ 2 recoiless rifles and 1rpg. Their flag is green with a blue border.

This should be interesting. I did base this off what I could wargame it with, and am looking at 1/285 GHQ microarmour models to use, or 15mm Flames of War starter set. Either way should be fun, and am looking forward to setting up a table to use with interesting terrain. Stay posted for model pics and writeups.
