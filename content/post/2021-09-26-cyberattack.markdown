At work last week, I saw my first real cyber attack. It involved a comprimised user account and our VPN, and I saw how woefully unprepared our org was for such an event. The IT team did not really know how to respond, and we had so little in place in terms of safeguards or even watchguards. I'm glad that I have embraced security as my profession, and am able to help people in this world of cyber crime. It has helped me make my choice on career and certs in the remainder of the year.
