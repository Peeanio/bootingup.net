I've been really feeling stepping up my DevSecOps skills, after really feeling comfortable working with chef and ansible to run configs. I found roadmap.sh, and found myself most of the way down the roadmap for DevOps. I'm halfway through the Infrastructure as Code, needing to do infrastructure provisioning. I've written my own provisioning, but perhaps using Terraform can provide value, especially as my code was libvirt only. Being more agile with regards to deployment zone makes the code portable.

In addition to the roadmap's goals, I want to add on some security goals. Learning how to do hardening, auditing, and compliance checking are things that are truly needed. Hopefully that will get me back onto some security/pen-testing world that I find interesting, but my interests are both devout and fleeting if I don't learn or implement it quickly. Learning hacking was hard for me as the fuzzing and creative approaches of targets weren't easy for me to grasp fully. Time will tell however, and I'm excited for the whole career to come...
