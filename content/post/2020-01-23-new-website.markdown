I want more control over my website than I feel I have here. I am currently hosting on github pages, and want to move towards a more complete web stack with a new static website. Hugo looks cool, but the call of raw HTML is always there. My site is just a quick blog as of now, and there are not too many plans of expansion (of the web portion, at least), so it feels manageable. Just throwing my ideas down. 

For anyone reading, let me know what you think!
