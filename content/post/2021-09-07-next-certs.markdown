With a new move fresh under my belt and a sense of relief in my new locale and life, I t may be time to approach a new certification. I have some ideas of paths to follow, but as I climb the cert ladder, they all start to get pricey, which is daunting while self funding. Still cheaper than the college I self-funded, however. 

I'm looking at going up to CCNP as my next network cert; I don't know if CompTIA does a higher than Network+, and anything I learn there is applicable to most other vendors. Going with another bottom tier cert seems silly, and I like learning about complex networks that I have not been able to touch myself.

For security I am torn; CISSP is big and expensive and totally desireable, so its something that draws me in. Having Secrity+ and some other Sec classes down should make it at least some review, but having some trench work cert like CEH would hopefully give me some practical experience towards being a pentester if I wanted that route. 

Lastly, there's always more sysadmin certs. K8s should be something I know, and Linux Foundation certs aren't too strenous, so I could shoot for that, but not something that really pulls me in yet. Likely because I haven't seen the need for that hyper container world yet. 

Getting better at programming for whichever route is on my list too, so stay tuned for that. Wish me luck.
