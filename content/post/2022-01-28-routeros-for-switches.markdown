In my home lab, I have had Mikrotik gear for a long time. It's cheap, very adaptable, and could almost be confused for Linux. My CRS226 used to server as my main router, but after moving to OPNSense, it's been regulated to switch duties. As a switch, its something that takes getting used to for people used to Cisco-like gear. 

Vlan tagging is difficult to get at first, as the nomenclature is very different, using ingress and egree vlan tags instead of native vlans and trunks. They also are configured in groups of the same config, instead of defining config per port. Its just something so different from Linux and Cisco that its a little unappealing. I would love to get some Linux switches, but the open firmware and whitebox world is very expensive second hand, and there isn't a quick and easy start. The projects have seemed to have totally changed hands and what is in vogue, but hopefully we'll see that change soon. If I'm wrong, please let me know!
