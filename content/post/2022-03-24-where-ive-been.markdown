It's been a while since I was able to update here, for serveral reasons. First, I was accepted for a Masters at UC Berkeley, and was trying to make that work. Second, I made no progress with Keycloak behind haproxy. Finally, there's been no other code to show you as its all been on work git servers.

Starting with the UC. I applied for the MICS, or Masters of Information in Cyber Security. The school charged a princely sum of $80k USD to do the course, and with everything I tried, that number never got comfortable. I'm scrapping that plan, moving forward with self-taught hard skills (golang, CEH), and if I want a masters, I can go back to WGU.

Keycloak is really a pain behind haproxy with docker. No container provides an easy out of box experience, needing to pass headers through the proxy WHILE running the config in the container, which even the first party version from quay didn't make easy. So my thought is to not mess with it right now, and push forward with a self-signed port provided by the server (for now) to see if its even worth pursuing. 

While most of my at home time has been dedicated to the CEH cert lately, at work I've been putting so Go learning to use, working on network mapping and dynamic inventory scripts. Hopefully, I can share all that with people soon, so that there's something to show for my time. Both of those pursuits have been fun.

Lately, I've also been hankering for some LoRa radio action, so I hope to get back on THAT train once I finish up some other projects. While all that is going on, there's still the possibility that I may want to switch jobs, so who knows what the next post will be.
