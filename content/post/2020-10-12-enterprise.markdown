I noticed lately how sometimes at work the pursuit of stability, reliability, and repeatability took some of the fun out of servers and networking. There's a lot of reassurance and calm that comes from these things, but that doesn't make it fun all of the time. Having a very fast time to production and trying several different solutions is a bit of a hacker's thrill, but can get lost the larger the enterprise. This should not be a surprise to anyone, but something that they need to consider when moving up a bracket. 

Another thing that can get in the way of an enjoyable day is taking prebuilt tools. Docker is something that makes application deployment fast, but you lose some interface time with the server and may not even know what the application does under the hood. Some call this fun, some experience, but either way it is a valuable step in keeping interest and skills sharp and applicable to the job at hand. There's nothing like wanting to do work to keep it moving along.
