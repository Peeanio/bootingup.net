I want to start pushing my career from network and sysadmin, towards the devops side of things. I have been working on the methodology and tools of the trade for a while now, things like scripting and automation. I have lots of experience with virtualisation, and some with containers, but I want to take it to the next level. Learning to write, manage, and hopefully cluster or failover Docker/LXC containers are on the agenda. More experience with other scripting/programming languages will be important to working on this devops ideal. I have a good handle on shell, and could sharpen up my Python skills and go from there. But that's not this newest project.

The goal is build an internal office domain, that can be sized up and down dynamically, with users free to move to move to different machines throughout the domain, with easily manageable authentication and configurations. My ideas are to build a vm cluster with automated KVM/LXC creation, PXE/netbooting to preseeded configs for VMs, a FreeIPA or similar domain controller, with DHCP and DNS tie-ins, using Ansible to deploy and maintain configurations, and possibly some form of remote access such as VNC or other secure protocol. Doing this corporate domain build out and then maintainace will give me not only the experience with such important technologies, but also a new enviornment to test devops practices and procedures. I will document all, and bring back what I can to the site for presentation. 

Thanks for following me on this endevour!
